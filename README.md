## Description

This repository features a complete collection of code examples/sketches/projects used in my thesis "Implementing a Mesh Routing Algorithm for the LoRa Protocol on the ESP32". The project resulted in the development of LoRaDiMe, short for Long Range Directed Mesh, which is a protocol enabling multiple devices to periodically send payloads to a predefined destination over multiple hops. LoRaDiMe therefore creates an ad hoc mesh network, which allows mobile and battery powered devices to dynamically self-configure. More information can be found in my thesis, which will be available soon. In the mean time, the code for LoRaDiMe is available here:
