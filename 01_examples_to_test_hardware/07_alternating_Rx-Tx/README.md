## Alternating Receiver and Transmitter 

These sketches try to implemented a back and forth communication between two LILYGO TTGO T-Beams v0.7 using the LoRa.h library.

1. T-Beam A will send a message to T-Beam B. 
2. T-Beam B receives the message and sends back a confirmation message back to T-Beam B. 
3. Repeat every 5 seconds.
