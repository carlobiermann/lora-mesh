## Testing all msgTypes 

The Mesh Algorithm relies on sending different *types* of messages throughout the network.
LoRa Nodes (LN) and the Gateway Node (GW) react differently to each type of message. 

Testing *receiving* all types of messages with: 
- /GW_msgReceiver 
- /LN_msgReceiver 

Testing *sending* all types of messages with: 
- /LN_msgTester
